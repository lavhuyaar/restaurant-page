# The Odin Project 10 - Restaurant Page

Yayyy, completed the project after 2 days. At first I was really confused whether webpack is something worth to learn or not, but building this project made me realize the usefulness of webpack. Learned some new methods which I'm sure i'll never forget.

Also I took some time to make this a responsive website, I'm proud of myself hehe :)
